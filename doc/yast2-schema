Generate RNG Schema from RNC and RNY Files
==========================================


How It Works
------------

The individual YaST packages carry their part of the schema with them
in RNC form and install it to /usr/share/YaST2/schema/autoyast/rnc.
At build time, yast2-schema.rpm takes all these files and writes a
master file, profile.rnc, that references all these pieces.
It also converts RNC to RNG because the latter format has alightweight
validator.

(RNY is not used yet)

How to Move the Schema to Your Module
-------------------------------------

Basically, move the rnc file from autoyast.rpm to your package and
enter its name to your desktop file. Details follow.

Go to trunk/autoinstallation/src/data/rng. Find your schema part there
and move it (svn mv) somewhere to your module. Don't forget to remove
it from the Makefile.am in autoinstallation.

Edit the desktop file in your module and add
  X-SuSE-YaST-AutoInstSchema=foo.rnc
where foo.rnc is the schema part.

In Makefile.am, add
  rncdir =  $(schemadir)/autoyast/rnc
  rnc_DATA = foo.rnc
and add $(rnc_DATA) to EXTRA_DIST.
Add @schemadir@/autoyast/rnc/foo.rnc to the spec file list.
